Source code for my personal website at [www.jonbartlett.org](http://www.jonbartlett.org)
 
Hosted here at [GitHub](http://www.github.com).
 
Built with [Poole](https://github.com/poole/poole) and [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/).

*NOTE*: If you fork or re-use this project, please be sure you:

* Edit ```_includes/google_analytics.html``` and either
  1. Replace the Google Analytics tracking code with your own, or
  2. If you don't use Google Analytics, comment the block of code out entirely.

Otherwise I will receive GA data from your website.
