title: Dave Yates Bicycle Frame Building Course 
comments: true
---

I have had long term aspirations to build my own bicycle frame from scratch. I have only ever bought one bike that came assembled. Most of my bikes I end up finding parts for, and building myself. The last piece to build was a frame.

Dave Yates Cycles run frame building courses out of a small workshop in the UK countryside. The countryside happens to be very familiar to me as it is not too far from where I was brought up in the county of Lincolnshire. Dave Yates himself was a pioneer in the early days of the UK Mountain Bike scene in the early 1990's. This was when mountain bikes could not be bought from major manufacturers as the sport was relatively new and was really based in the US. Dave hand built the first mountain bikes in the UK and those which still exist today are somewhat of a collectors item.

Fast forward a few years and having run a successful framebuilding business in the North East of England, Dave is now setup shop where he is now. Continuing to build custom frames to specification, Dave also runs highly regarded frame building courses.

Having put my name on a waiting list two years prior, I was booked in for a weeks cource in the summer. The courses require no pre-requisites however it is a good idea to have researched the type of frame you want to build and choice of materials. To maintain the quality of the final product, only 2 students are taken on at any given time. This ensures you have Dave's full attention at all times and really makes a difference.
